# **App Name**: EthioJobsConnect

## Core Features:

- Job Listing Display: Displays job listings with title, company, location, snippet, and a direct link to the original job posting. Each listing is displayed in a card format.
- Keyword Search: Enables users to search for jobs by keywords (title, company) and location (major Ethiopian cities) using a prominent search bar.
- Job Filters: Allows users to filter job listings by industry, job type, experience level, or specific companies on a sidebar.
- Client-Side Pagination: Implements pagination to handle long lists of job postings.
- External Application Link: Navigates users to the original job posting URL on the recruiter's website via a clearly labeled button ('View Job' or 'Apply Now').
- Adsense Integration: Ad slots are strategically placed within the site layout (header, main content) for monetization through Google AdSense. Ad placements should integrate seamlessly.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark slate blue (#374785) for a professional and trustworthy feel.
- Background color: Light gray (#E8EAF6) for a clean and neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: Vivid cyan (#00BCD4) to highlight important links and CTAs, such as job application buttons.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for readability and a modern feel. 'Source Code Pro' for displaying the JSON data structure and example code.
- Bootstrap 5 grid system will be the basis for responsive layouts, adapting to different screen sizes. Header, main content, and footer sections are clearly defined. Ad placements are integrated to be non-intrusive.
- Clean, simple icons will be used for social media links in the footer and to indicate job categories in the listings. Icons should be consistent in style.
- Subtle animations or transitions (e.g., fading in new job listings or a smooth scroll to top when navigating pages) to enhance the user experience.
